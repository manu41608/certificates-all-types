Perfect ‚Äî using **Microsoft ADCS (Active Directory Certificate Services)** as an **internal Certificate Authority (CA)** is a very common enterprise-grade solution, especially when you want to issue and manage certificates within your **organization-controlled PKI** (Private Key Infrastructure).

Let‚Äôs walk through how you can use **Microsoft ADCS to issue SSL certificates** and use them with **Azure Application Gateway + App Service** ‚Äî step by step.

---

## üß± 1. What is Microsoft ADCS?

**Microsoft ADCS** is a role in Windows Server that lets you:

* Create a **Root CA** and/or **Intermediate CA**
* Issue certificates for users, devices, services
* Use **certificate templates**, auto-enrollment, and policies

> üõ°Ô∏è Great for internal apps, testing, or enterprise apps not exposed to the public internet.

## ‚úÖ 2. End-to-End Setup Overview

```plaintext
[Internal CA (ADCS)]
    ‚Üì issues cert
[Your Team]
    ‚Üì exports cert in PFX
[Azure Application Gateway]
    ‚Üì HTTPS
[App Service or Backend App]
```

---

## üîß 3. Step-by-Step: Using Microsoft ADCS for Azure App Gateway

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Install Microsoft ADCS (if not already)

On a Windows Server:

```bash
Server Manager ‚Üí Add Roles ‚Üí Active Directory Certificate Services
```

* Add **Certification Authority**
* Choose to set up as:

  * **Root CA** or
  * **Subordinate CA** (best practice in enterprises)

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Create a Web Server Certificate Template

1. Open **Certification Authority**
2. Right-click on **Certificate Templates ‚Üí Manage**
3. Duplicate the **Web Server** template
4. Name it (e.g., `AppGatewaySSL`)
5. In properties:

   * Enable **export of private key**
   * Set **Subject Name** to `Supply in the request`
   * Set key usage: **Digital Signature, Key Encipherment**
6. Publish it:

   * Right-click **Certificate Templates ‚Üí New ‚Üí Certificate Template to Issue**

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Request a Certificate

From a Windows machine (domain-joined):

#### Option 1: GUI

1. Open **MMC ‚Üí Certificates ‚Üí Local Computer**
2. Right-click **Personal ‚Üí All Tasks ‚Üí Request New Certificate**
3. Select the `AppGatewaySSL` template
4. Enter **Common Name (CN)** like `myapp.company.local`
5. Finish and get the cert

#### Option 2: Command Line (certreq)

```cmd
certreq -submit -attrib "CertificateTemplate:AppGatewaySSL" myapp.req
```

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Export Certificate with Private Key as `.pfx`

Once the cert is installed:

1. Open **MMC > Certificates > Personal > Certificates**
2. Right-click your cert ‚Üí **All Tasks ‚Üí Export**
3. Choose:

   * Yes, export the private key
   * Format: `.PFX`
   * Include all certs in the chain (intermediate, root)
4. Set a password ‚Üí Save `.pfx`

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Upload to Azure Application Gateway

In Azure Portal:

1. Go to your **Application Gateway**
2. Go to **Listeners ‚Üí Add Listener**
3. Choose HTTPS
4. Upload `.pfx`
5. Enter password from export step

‚úÖ Now App Gateway uses your **internally signed certificate**.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 6. Optional: Secure Backend Traffic (App Gateway ‚Üí App Service)

If you're also using HTTPS on your **backend** (e.g., App Service):

* You can **bind a custom domain cert** (same or different)
* If the cert is from **your internal ADCS**, App Gateway won't trust it **by default**

### To Fix This:

* In **HTTP settings ‚Üí Enable SSL certificate verification**
* Upload the **Root CA certificate** (in `.cer` or `.pem` format)

This tells App Gateway to trust your internal CA.

## üîÅ 7. Renewal Strategy (Manual or Automated)

| Option        | How                                                                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manual**    | Re-request certificate via MMC, re-export, re-upload to Azure                                 |
| **Automated** | Use PowerShell + `certreq` + Azure CLI scripts (can integrate into pipelines)                 |
| **Modern**    | Use **Venafi**, **Key Vault + ADCS Integration**, or **Intune** for cert lifecycle management |

## ‚úÖ TL;DR: Internal CA (ADCS) + Azure Gateway

| Step                      | Tool                         | Purpose                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Issue cert                | Microsoft ADCS               | Create cert for App Gateway listener                          |
| Export cert               | MMC or PowerShell            | Export `.pfx` with private key                                |
| Upload to Azure           | Azure Portal or CLI          | Configure HTTPS listener                                      |
| (Optional) Upload CA cert | HTTP settings in App Gateway | Enable backend SSL verification if backend uses internal cert |

Would you like a ready-made PowerShell script that:

* Requests a cert from ADCS
* Exports it as `.pfx`
* Uploads it to Azure via CLI?

Or a visual guide (screenshots + steps) for setting this up on a Windows server?
